# pdf-cli-reader

A Mac CLI PDF reader with styled text, inline images, full-text search, interactive table of contents, and resume support. Runs entirely from a project-local Python virtual environment — no global installs required.

---

## Features

- **Styled text rendering** — headings, bold, italic, and monospaced/code blocks are detected from PDF font metadata and rendered with appropriate colors and styles
- **Inline image display** — image-heavy pages render as ANSI half-block art in any true-color terminal (macOS Terminal.app, iTerm2, etc.); iTerm2 and Kitty get native high-quality protocol rendering
- **Inline image view for any page** — press `i` to rasterize and view the current page as an image regardless of content type; useful for diagrams, math, and complex layouts
- **OCR fallback** — scanned/image-only PDFs are processed with macOS Vision framework via `ocrmac` (no Tesseract binary required)
- **Interactive table of contents** — arrow-key navigation with smooth in-place redraws, no screen flashing
- **Full-text search** — search across all pages with `n`/`N` to jump between matches, highlighted in page text
- **Resume support** — automatically saves and restores your last reading position per PDF
- **Lazy page loading** — pages are loaded one at a time; large PDFs open instantly
- **Structured header** — book title, current chapter, progress bar, and page counter on every page
- **Persistent footer** — all keyboard shortcuts visible at all times
- **WCAG-compliant colors** — all UI colors checked for minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio; adapts between dark and light terminal themes

## Requirements

- macOS (uses macOS Vision framework for OCR)
- Python 3.9+
- No system-level dependencies — everything installs into the project `.venv/`

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashish-puttaa/pdf-cli-reader-vibes.git
cd pdf-cli-reader-vibes

python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install pymupdf rich click ocrmac pillow
```

Then make the launcher executable:

```bash
chmod +x pdf
```

Optionally symlink to your PATH for global access:

```bash
ln -s "$(pwd)/pdf" /usr/local/bin/pdf
```

---

## Usage

```
./pdf <path-to-pdf> [OPTIONS]
```

### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-p`, `--pages` | all | Page range, e.g. `1-10` or `2,4,7` |
| `--ocr` / `--no-ocr` | on | OCR image-heavy pages with macOS Vision |
| `--ocr-threshold` | 50 | Min characters on a page before falling back to OCR |
| `--images` / `--no-images` | on | Render image pages inline |
| `--plain` | off | Plain text output (good for piping or scripts) |
| `--meta` | off | Show PDF metadata and exit |

### Examples

```bash
# Read a book
./pdf books/my-book.pdf

# Start from page 42
./pdf books/my-book.pdf -p 42

# Read pages 10–50 only
./pdf books/my-book.pdf -p 10-50

# Dump plain text
./pdf books/my-book.pdf --plain > output.txt

# Show metadata
./pdf books/my-book.pdf --meta
```

## How It Works

### Text rendering

Pages are parsed with PyMuPDF's `get_text("dict")` which returns font metadata per span. The reader uses this to detect:

- **Headings** — spans whose font size is ≥ 1.2× the body font size
- **Bold / italic** — font flags bitmask (bits 16 and 2) or font name keywords
- **Monospaced / code blocks** — font flags bit 8 or font names containing `mono`, `courier`, `code`, etc.
- **Garbage spans** — sub-1pt spans (embedded font data) and spans where fewer than 50% of characters are printable are filtered out. Non-printable control characters within otherwise readable spans are also stripped before display.

Body font size is computed from spans ≥ 9pt to prevent footnotes and figure labels from skewing the heading detection threshold. Lines within prose blocks are reflowed (joined with spaces, hyphenation preserved). Lines within monospaced blocks are preserved exactly as-is.

### Image rendering

Pages are classified as image-heavy if:
- Image coverage > 70% of page area (always renders as image — handles photography books where full-page photos appear alongside substantial body text), or
- Image coverage > 45% **and** text is sparse (< 50 characters)

When a page is image-heavy and also contains more than 300 characters of body text (e.g. photography books with captions), both the image and the text are shown.

Image-heavy pages are rasterized at 200 DPI and displayed via:
1. **Kitty graphics protocol** — if `KITTY_WINDOW_ID` or `TERM=xterm-kitty`
2. **iTerm2 inline images** — if `TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app` or `WezTerm`/`Hyper`
3. **ANSI half-block art** — universal fallback using `▀` with 24-bit fg/bg colors, scales to fit terminal width and height

Press `i` on any page to view it rasterized as an inline image — useful when text extraction is poor (complex diagrams, vector graphics with custom font encodings, math-heavy pages). Press any key to return to the text view.

Press `v` on any page to open it in macOS Preview at full resolution.

### OCR

When a page is image-heavy but `--images` is disabled (or the page has no detected images), OCR is attempted using `ocrmac`, which calls the macOS Vision framework directly via PyObjC. No Tesseract binary is needed.

### Resume

Reading position is saved to `~/.cache/pdf-reader/<filename>.json` after each page turn and restored on next open.

## Color Scheme

Colors are chosen for WCAG AA compliance (≥ 4.5:1 contrast ratio) against both dark and light terminal backgrounds.

| Element | Dark terminal | Light terminal |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| H1 headings | `bright_yellow` | `bright_yellow` |
| H2 headings | `bright_cyan` | `bright_cyan` |
| H3 headings | `bright_blue` | `bright_blue` |
| Code / monospaced | `#ABABAB` (light grey) | `#595959` (dark grey) |
| Search highlight | black on `bright_yellow` | black on `bright_yellow` |

Terminal theme is auto-detected via the `COLORFGBG` environment variable (set by Terminal.app, iTerm2, Konsole, and xterm). Falls back to dark if unset.
